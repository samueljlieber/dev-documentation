Price management
================

Odoo offers multiple options to select the price displayed on your website, as well as
condition-specific prices based on selected criteria.

Tax inclusion
=============

Choosing the displayed price tax usually depends on a country's regulations or the type of customers
**(B2B vs B2C)**. To select the type of price displayed, go to :menuselection:`Website app -->
Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Shop - Products` category, and select
:guilabel:`Tax Excluded` or :guilabel:`Tax Included`.

Note that this setting is **global**, and the tax-display type is the same for your website(s) and
back-end. It is therefore not possible to select different tax displays for different websites. This
may be a significant point of consideration when implementing a database with multiple ecommerce
websites pertaining to different types of customers (i.e. B2B and B2C).

- :guilabel:`Tax Excluded`: the price displayed on the website is **tax-excluded** and the tax is
  computed at the cart-review step;
- :guilabel:`Tax Included`: the price displayed on the website is **tax-included**.

You can choose to display the type of pricing next to the product price, by going to
:menuselection:`Website app --> Site --> Homepage --> Shop`, selecting one of your product, and then
:menuselection:`Edit --> Customize tab` and enabling :guilabel:`Tax Indication`.

Price per unit
==============

It is possible to display a
:doc:`price per unit <../../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/management/products/uom>` on the product
page. To do that, go to :menuselection:`Website app --> Configuration --> Settings` and enable
:guilabel:`Product Reference Price` under the :guilabel:`Shop - Products`. When enabled, make sure
an amount is set in the :guilabel:`Base Unit Count` field of the **product template**, as well as in
the :guilabel:`Sales Price`. The price per unit of measure can be found above the :guilabel:`Add to
Cart` button on the product page.

Price configuration
===================

Pricelists
----------

Pricelists are the main tool to manage prices on your eCommerce. They allow you to define
website-specific prices - different from the price on the product template - based on **country
groups**, **currency**, **minimum quantity**, **period**, or **variants**. You can create as many
pricelists as needed, but it is mandatory to have at least one pricelist available on a website. If
no custom pricelists are added, Odoo defaults to the **Public Pricelist** for all websites.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pricelists can be found under :menuselection:`Website app --> eCommerce --> Pricelists`, but must
first be activated. For that, head to :menuselection:`Website app --> Configuration --> Settings`
and scroll down to the :guilabel:`Shop - Products` section. There, you can find two options:

- :guilabel:`Multiple prices per product`;
- :guilabel:`Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas)`.

The **first** option allows you to set different prices per customer *segment*, i.e., registered
customers, gold customers, regular customers, etc. The **second** option allows you to set *price
change* rules such as **discounts**, **margins**, **roundings**, etc.

Foreign currency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are selling in **multiple currencies** and have pricelists in foreign currencies, customers
can select their corresponding pricelist anywhere on the :guilabel:`Shop` page from the drop-down
menu next to the **search bar**.

Discount and loyalty programs
=============================

Discount and loyalty
--------------------

It is possible to create promotion and loyalty programs, which offer different options from
pricelists. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website app --> eCommerce --> Discount & Loyalty`, and
:guilabel:`Create` a program from scratch or by using the templates. You can also modify an existing
program by clicking on it.

Permanent discount
------------------

If you have permanently reduced the price of a product, a popular means to attract customers is the
**strikethrough** strategy. The strategy consists in displaying the previous price crossed-out, and
the **new discounted price** next to it.

.. image:: price_management/price-strikethrough.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Price strikethrough

To display a 'striked' price, first enable the :guilabel:`Comparison Price` option under
:menuselection:`Website app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Shop - Products category`. Then, head
to the product's template (:menuselection:`Website app --> eCommerce --> Products`) and in the
:guilabel:`Compare to Price` field, enter the **new** price.
